# SaaS Product Usage & Retention Analysis

## Project Overview

This Business Intelligence project analyses product adoption, engagement, retention, and churn across a SaaS platform using SQL, data modelling, and Power BI.

## Business Problem

The objective of this project is to help Product and Customer Success stakeholders understand:

- Product Performance
- Feature Adoption
- Customer Retention
- Customer Churn
- Overall Business Trends

## Analytical Approach

The analysis followed a structured Business Intelligence workflow:

Business Context → Data Modeling → Data Validation → Business Questions → KPI Definition → KPI Logic → SQL Development → Dashboard Design

Supporting documentation is available in the repository:

- [Business Questions and KPI Definition](Business_Questions_and_KPIs_Definition/)

## Dashboard Preview

## Key Findings

- Feature adoption remained consistently high across all major product features.

- Customer retention remained low despite strong feature usage and engagement.

- Product usage alone does not appear to fully explain customer retention and churn outcomes, suggesting that additional customer-level factors should be investigated.

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL
- Data Modelling
- Power BI
- KPI Design
- Product Analytics
- Data Storytelling

# Business Understanding

## Stakeholder

Product Manager

## Stakeholder Goal

Understand how customers interact with product features and identify whether specific usage patterns are associated with retention or churn.

## Business Questions & KPI Framework 

### Which product features drive the highest user engagement?

**KPIs**

- Total Feature Usage
- Total Usage Duration Mins

**Business Purpose**

Measures feature engagement.

### How frequently are product features used?

**KPI**

- Feature Usage Frequency | can be calculated Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly

**Business Purpose**

Measures how often features are used in a specific time window.

### How much time do users spend using each feature?

**KPIs**

- Total Usage Duration Mins 
- Average Usage Duration Mins 
- Average Usage Count 

**Business Purpose**

Measures time spent using each feature.

### Which features are associated with higher customer retention?

**KPI**

- Retention Rate By Feature

**Business Purpose**

Measures how many accounts did not cancel.

### Which features are associated with higher customer churn?

**KPI**

- Churn Rate By Feature

**Business Purpose**

Measures how many accounts did cancel.

### Which features show low adoption and may require improvement?

**KPIs**

- Feature Adoption Rate
- Total Feature Usage

**Business Purpose**

Measures how many accounts are effectively using a feature.

## Analytical Findings

Supporting Queries Script is available here:

- [KPIs Calculation MySQL](SQL_Scripts/KPIs_Calculation_MySQL.sql)

The SQL analysis identified several notable patterns before dashboard development:

- Feature adoption remained consistently high across all product features, ranging between 72% and 82%.

- Feature usage was relatively balanced across the product portfolio, with no feature showing critically low engagement.

- The most frequently used features also generated the highest total usage duration, indicating sustained engagement rather than occasional interactions.

- Retention rates remained relatively similar across all features, suggesting that no individual feature emerged as a clear retention driver.

- Churn and retention patterns indicate that additional variables such as customer characteristics, subscription plans, industry segments, or churn reasons should be investigated in future analyses.
