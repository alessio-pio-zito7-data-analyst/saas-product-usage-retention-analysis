# SaaS Product Usage & Retention Analysis

## Project Overview

This Business Intelligence project analyses product adoption, engagement, retention, and churn across a SaaS platform using SQL, data modelling, and Power BI.

## Business Problem

The objective of this project is to help Product and Customer Success stakeholders understand:

- Product Performance
- Feature Adoption
- Customer Retention
- Customer Churn
- Overall Business Trends

## Analytical Approach

The analysis followed a structured Business Intelligence workflow:

Business Context → Data Modeling → Data Validation → Business Questions → KPI Definition → KPI Logic → SQL Development → Dashboard Design

The business questions, KPI definitions, KPI calculation logic, and SQL-based findings were documented before dashboard design.

Supporting documentation is available in the repository:

- [Business Questions and KPI Definition](Business_Questions_and_KPIs_Definition/)

## Dashboard Preview

![Dashboard Preview](Power%20BI/Power_BI_Dashboard_Screenshot.png)

## Key Findings

- Feature adoption remained consistently high across all major product features.

- Customer retention remained low despite strong feature usage and engagement.

- Product usage alone does not appear to fully explain customer retention and churn outcomes, suggesting that additional customer-level factors should be investigated.

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL
- Data Modelling
- Power BI
- KPI Design
- Product Analytics
- Data Storytelling

# Business Understanding

## Stakeholder

Product Manager

## Stakeholder Goal

Understand how customers interact with product features and identify whether specific usage patterns are associated with retention or churn.

## Business Questions & KPI Framework 

### Which product features drive the highest user engagement?

**KPIs**

- Total Feature Usage
- Total Usage Duration Mins

**Business Purpose**

Measures feature engagement.

### How frequently are product features used?

**KPI**

- Feature Usage Frequency | can be calculated Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly

**Business Purpose**

Measures how often features are used in a specific time window.

### How much time do users spend using each feature?

**KPIs**

- Total Usage Duration Mins 
- Average Usage Duration Mins 
- Average Usage Count 

**Business Purpose**

Measures time spent using each feature.

### Which features are associated with higher customer retention?

**KPI**

- Retention Rate By Feature

**Business Purpose**

Measures how many accounts did not cancel.

### Which features are associated with higher customer churn?

**KPI**

- Churn Rate By Feature

**Business Purpose**

Measures how many accounts did cancel.

### Which features show low adoption and may require improvement?

**KPIs**

- Feature Adoption Rate
- Total Feature Usage

**Business Purpose**

Measures how many accounts are effectively using a feature.

## Analytical Findings

Supporting Queries Script is available here:

- [KPIs Calculation MySQL](SQL_Scripts/KPIs_Calculation_MySQL.sql)

The SQL analysis identified several notable patterns before dashboard development:

- Feature adoption remained consistently high across all product features, ranging between 72% and 82%.

- Feature usage was relatively balanced across the product portfolio, with no feature showing critically low engagement.

- The most frequently used features also generated the highest total usage duration, indicating sustained engagement rather than occasional interactions.

- Retention rates remained relatively similar across all features, suggesting that no individual feature emerged as a clear retention driver.

- Churn and retention patterns indicate that additional variables such as customer characteristics, subscription plans, industry segments, or churn reasons should be investigated in future analyses.

# Technical Implementation

## Data Quality & Validation

Before building the analytical model and calculating KPIs, the dataset underwent a structured data ingestion, debugging, and validation process.

A separate project was created to document the complete data preparation workflow, including data ingestion, source-level validation, debugging activities, and data quality checks.

**Previous Project Documentation**

- [SaaS Dataset Cleaning & Data Modelling Project](https://github.com/alessio-pio-zito7-data-analyst/SaaS-Dataset-Cleaning-Data-Modelling-Project)

## Issues Identified in the Original Dataset

During the ingestion and exploration process, several inconsistencies were identified, including:

- misleading boolean flags
- duplicated identifiers
- mixed business logic
- formatting and NULL issues
- inconsistent relational modelling
- subscription logic stored in non-normalized structures

These issues would have compromised:
- metric consistency
- relational integrity
- KPI reliability
- downstream analytical accuracy

### Data Ingestion & Source Validation

The raw SaaS dataset was imported into MySQL and validated before analytical modelling.

## Data Model Schema

Final relational dataset model created after the cleaning and restructuring process using Excel and MySQL.
The dataset model was created in Power BI.

Documented activities included:

- Data ingestion using SQL scripts
- Primary Key validation
- Foreign Key validation
- Null and missing value checks
- Whitespace and formatting checks
- Business logic validation
- Data debugging and correction of identified issues

## Data Model

A Star Schema data model was designed to support KPI calculation, trend analysis, customer segmentation, and dashboard performance.

The model separates business events (facts) from descriptive attributes (dimensions), following common Business Intelligence modelling practices.

## Star Schema

The analytical model consists of two fact tables and three dimension tables designed to support product usage, retention, churn, and time-series analysis.

### Relationship Validation

After creating the fact and dimension tables, additional validation was performed to verify the integrity of the analytical model.

Validation activities included:

- Dimension Primary Key uniqueness checks
- Orphan record detection
- Referential integrity validation
- Fact-to-dimension relationship validation

**Supporting Documentation**

- [Fact & Dimension Tables Creation Script](SQL_Scripts/Fact_&_Dimension_Tables.sql)
- [Relationship Validation Checks](SQL_Scripts/Relationships_Checks.sql)

These validation steps ensured that KPI calculations and dashboard metrics were built on a reliable and consistent analytical model.

## KPI Calculation Logic

Before SQL development, the calculation logic for each KPI was documented, including formulas, source tables, and required joins.

**Supporting Documentation**

- [KPI Calculation Sheet](Business_Questions_and_KPIs_Definition/KPI_Calculation_Sheet.md)

| KPI | Formula | Source Tables |
|------|------|------|
| Total Feature Usage | SUM(usage_count) | fact_feature_usage |
| Total Usage Duration Mins | SUM(usage_duration_mins) | fact_feature_usage |
| Feature Usage Frequency | SUM(usage_count) by day/week/month/year | fact_feature_usage |
| Average Usage Duration Mins | AVG(usage_duration_mins) | fact_feature_usage |
| Average Usage Count | AVG(usage_count) | fact_feature_usage |
| Retention Rate By Feature | Retained Accounts Using Feature / Total Accounts Using Feature | fact_feature_usage, dim_subscriptions, dim_accounts, fact_churn_events |
| Churn Rate By Feature | Churned Accounts Using Feature / Total Accounts Using Feature | fact_feature_usage, dim_subscriptions, dim_accounts, fact_churn_events |
| Feature Adoption Rate | Accounts Using Feature / Total Active Accounts | fact_feature_usage, dim_subscriptions, dim_accounts |

## SQL Development

SQL was used throughout the project to:

- Create fact and dimension views
- Validate data quality and relationships
- Calculate KPI metrics
- Generate analytical datasets for Power BI

Each KPI was initially developed as a standalone SQL query to validate the calculation logic and answer the corresponding business question.

Where relevant, KPI calculations were structured to support year-over-year and time-series analysis for the 2023–2024 period. Other KPIs were intentionally aggregated across the full analysis period (both 2023 and 2024) to align with the dashboard design and business reporting requirements.

Once validated, the KPI queries were converted into SQL views and used as the primary data source for Power BI reporting.

This approach centralized business logic within the database layer, reducing the need for complex Power BI calculations while improving model simplicity, maintainability, and performance.
